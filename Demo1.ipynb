    "Demo notebooks are not assignments. Rather they are an opportunity for me to lecture or pre-record a demonstration of some particular computer science code or principles.

Sometimes I will mix in some more advanced concepts, in order for you to see the direction we're headed. \n",

    "Imagine that we are working for a company that receives customer feedback forms, and our boss has directed us to sort these forms into various groupings. Additionally this company has three different stores, and they want to be able to see if there are trends that are different between each store. Your job is to write a function which takes these reviews and makes sense of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three documents, one for each store, and in each document a review will inhabit a single line (that's conveniently simple). Each review will be a narrative sentence, followed by a series of word number pairs. It will look something like this. \n",

    "> \"This store is awesome I love that I can buy anything I want. Great staff.\" staff: 5/5, cleanliness 3/5, selection: 4/5\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the first thing to note is that the simple data structures of int, str and the like are not going to get us where we want. The first thing to think about is how do we want to break this down. "
