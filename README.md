# cs1_2_demo_1

### Demo

This is a demo. That means that it is not an assignment, but that you will have access (by the same means as before: git clone the repository). The only difference is that I'm not going to create a specialized link for you, but rather you can simply access the public repository (I provided the link) and clone it onto your system.

Do not push to this repository. 

Please also note that this document is written in markdown. At this point I do not have any expectations that you know or use markdown, but it's coming down the pike. If you want to get a headstart on this, you can reference this resource. [Markdown reference](https://commonmark.org/help/)
